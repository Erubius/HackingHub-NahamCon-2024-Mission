# HackingHub-NahamCon-2024-Mission
This repository contains a web application penetration test styled report for the NahamCon 2024 Mission room available on HackingHub.io -- as a result, this report contains numerous spoilers for the room, though the focus of the report is on presenting the findings in a similar capacity to how a penetration test would be conducted.

Also included in this repository are examples of custom scripts that were created to assist with various tasks during the assessment period.

Full credit to the room goes to Adam Langley, @BuildHackSecure, you've made a wonderful challenge and I truly had a blast taking a stab at this room!
I would highly recommend giving it a try for yourself: https://app.hackinghub.io/hubs/nahamcon24
